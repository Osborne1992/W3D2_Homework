<center><h2>Volume Calculator!</h2></center>
<br />
<p>To calculate the volume of a 3D shape, first enter which shape!</p>
<p>Your options are (and should be written as): cube, sphere, cylinder, rectangular prism, cone, capsule</p>
<br />
<p>Now to actually calculate, follow the below instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cube - Enter the LENGTH into the FIRST NUMBER box, leaving the other two boxes, empty</li>
<li>Sphere - Enter the RADIUS into the FIRST NUMBER box, leaving the other two boxes, empty</li>
<li>Cylinder - Enter the RADIUS and HEIGHT into the FIRST and SECOND boxes, respectively. Leaving the final box, empty.</li>
<li>Rectangular Prism - Enter the HEIGHT, LENGTH and WIDTH into each box (order here does  not really matter)</li>
<li>Cone - Enter the RADIUS and HEIGHT into the FIRST and SECOND boxes, respectively. Leave the third box, empty</li>
<li>Capsule - Enter the RADIUS and LENGTH into the FIRST and SECOND boxes, respectively. Leave the third box, empty</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Hope that was easy to follow! Pop in your values, hit calculate and enjoy the free time you now have, because you don't need to do ridiculous calculations!</p>
